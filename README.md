C++ project that presents a road network where intersections and the roads that connect them are modeled as nodes and edges. Basic functions include reading the road network from a file, checking for links, finding a path that passes through all intersections, and finding the shortest path between two intersections using Dijkstra. It has menu to navigate yourself through the road network.
